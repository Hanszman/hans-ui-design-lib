The **Icon** component dynamically renders any icon from the [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) library using only the icon name.
It allows consuming projects (React, Angular, etc.) to use icons **without directly importing** `react-icons`, acting as a middleware for consistent usage across frameworks.

## Usage

To use the component you need to import it and include it in your React app.
Make sure you have already set up the [Hans UI Design Library](/docs/getting-started--docs) in your project.

```tsx
import { HansIcon } from 'hans-ui-design-lib';

export const Example = () => <HansIcon name="FaHome" iconSize="medium" />;
```

Here is a basic example:

<Primary />

## Properties

The component accepts the following properties:

<Controls />

## Sizes

Listed below are the possible sizes of the component:

<Canvas of={HansIconStories.Sizes} />

## Multiple Libraries

You can import icons for all react-icons libraries, such as:

- Fa => Font Awesome
- Md => Material Design
- Bi => BoxIcons
- Ai => Ant Design
- Bs => Bootstrap
- Io => Ionicons
- Ri => Remix
- Hi => Heroicons
- Pi => Phosphor
- Tb => Tabler
- Lu => Lucide

<Canvas of={HansIconStories.MultipleIcons} />
