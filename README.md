## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install hans-ui-design-lib
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### React:

If you're using React, you have to install the lib with npm (checkout the installation section of this document). In a root file of your application, define:

```tsx
import 'hans-ui-design-lib/style.css';

...

// Put the data-theme combination of your choice in the html or body tags:
// (if you don't choose it, the Fallback is gona be the combination1)
<html data-theme="combination1">
...
</html>
```

Import and use the component you wish passing the props you want:

```tsx
import { HansButton } from 'hans-ui-design-lib';

...
<HansButton label="Button"></HansButton>;
```

### Others:

If you're using other Technologies like Angular for example, you don't have to install it with npm, you just have to import the CDN links. In the root index.html of your application, define:

```html
<html data-theme="combination1">
  <!-- Put the data-theme combination of your choice in the html or body tags: -->
  <!-- (if you don't choose it, the Fallback is gona be the combination1) -->
  ...
  <head>
    ...
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://hans-ui-design-lib-cdn.vercel.app/hans-ui-design-lib.css"
    />
    <script src="https://hans-ui-design-lib-cdn.vercel.app/hans-ui-web-components.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

If you're using a technology like Angular, probably you're gonna have to declare CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA like this in your component:

```ts
import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  ...
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
...
```

And in your component html you can just call it like this, passing the props you want:

```html
<hans-button label="Button"></hans-button>
```

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hanszman/hans-ui-design-lib.git
cd hans-ui-design-lib
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Lint code:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Build the package:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## 🚢 Exporting

When developing a component, to export it to the lib, you can add those lines into the files:

```ts
// ./src/index.ts
export * from './components/YourComponent';
```

```css
/* ./src/styles/index.css */
@import '../components/yourComponent.scss';
```

## 📖 Documentation

The components are documented using **Storybook**.

Run Storybook:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

To build the static documentation:

```bash
npm run build:storybook
```

The build is going to generate the folder 'storybook-static' on the root of this application.
Vercel is ready to publish the Storybook documentation with this build command and this folder name.
Whenever you push your commits on 'main' branch, the Vercel deploy will be called.

## 🚢 Publishing to npm

Make sure you are logged in to npm:

```bash
npm login
```

or create a .npmrc file on the root of this application based on .npmrc-example and paste on the file the token you created on npm website.

Then build and publish:

```bash
npm run build
npm run publish:[UPDATE-TYPE]
```

UPDATE-TYPES: patch | minor | major

The build is going to generate the folder 'dist' on root of this application.
The command publish is going to update the npm lib.

To use the lib locally and feed your projects in development, run this command:

```bash
npm run build:local
```

On the consumer project update the package.json with the lib generated '.tgz' file's path on your machine:

"hans-ui-design-lib": "[PATH]/hans-ui-design-lib/dist/hans-ui-design-lib-0.0.52.tgz",

and then run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🚢 Publishing to CDN

Build and publish:

```bash
npm run build:cdn
```

The build is going to generate the folder 'cdn' on the root of this application.
Vercel is ready to publish the CDN remote entries with this build command and this folder name.
Whenever you push your commits on 'main' branch, the Vercel deploy will be called.
These are the production URL's:

https://hans-ui-design-lib-cdn.vercel.app/hans-ui-design-lib.css

https://hans-ui-design-lib-cdn.vercel.app/hans-ui-web-components.js

To run CDN locally and feed your projects in development, run this command:

```bash
npm run build:cdn-local
```

These are the local URL's:

http://localhost:5173/hans-ui-design-lib.css

http://localhost:5173/hans-ui-web-components.js
